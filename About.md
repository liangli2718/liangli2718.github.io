# About me

This is Liang who works as a software/algorithm engineer in automotive domain.

Outside work, I am a maker with the belief in open software and hardware. I explore and make things using Arduino, ESP8266/32, Raspberry Pi and all kinds of open hardware and software. Most recent explorations are in home automation.

In addition, I am a weekend climber(and started to be also active during weekdays...)
