# About me

My name is Liang Li (李梁), I work as a signal processing algorithm engineer for automotive Radar in NXP Semiconductors.

Outside work, I am a maker with the belief in open software and hardware. I explore and make things using Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi and all kinds of open hardware and software. Most recent applications are in home automation.

In addition, I am a weekend climber.
